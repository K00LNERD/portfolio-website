# Lovable Prompt: Srijan Varma's Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
Create a visually stunning, immersive personal portfolio website for Srijan Varma that tells his professional journey as an interactive timeline/roadmap. The site should showcase his evolution from a blockchain developer to a product management leader through a scrolling narrative experience that combines text, images, videos, and interactive elements.

## Design Philosophy & Core Concept

### Timeline/Roadmap Structure
- **Reverse chronological flow**: Start with the LATEST achievements (2025 - Present) at the top, scroll down to go back in time
- **Visual roadmap aesthetic**: Design should evoke a journey/path metaphor - like a career roadmap where each milestone is a "station" or "checkpoint"
- **Seamless scroll experience**: Single-page application with smooth scroll-triggered animations
- **Non-linear storytelling**: Allow users to jump between timeline sections while maintaining the narrative flow

### Visual Direction
- **Modern, Premium Feel**: Clean, sophisticated design with generous white space
- **Tech-Forward Aesthetic**: Incorporate subtle tech elements (blockchain motifs, circuit patterns, data visualizations) without being overwhelming
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary: Deep navy/midnight blue (#0A1929) for trust and professionalism
  - Accent: Electric blue/cyan (#00E5FF) for tech innovation
  - Secondary: Warm gold (#FFB020) for achievements/highlights
  - Neutral: Soft grays (#F5F7FA, #E0E7EF) for backgrounds
  - Success green (#10B981) for metrics and growth indicators

## Detailed Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section (Landing)
**Visual Components:**
- Full viewport height with parallax effect
- Animated name introduction: "SRIJAN VARMA" - large, bold, modern typography

- Background: Subtle animated gradient or particle effect suggesting connection/network nodes
- Scroll indicator: Animated arrow or text "Scroll to explore my journey" with smooth bounce animation

**Interactive Elements:**
